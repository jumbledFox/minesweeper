# Minesweeper

This is a little minesweeper game that I've been working on, written in Rust using the [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) framework.

It's built on top of my own implementation of an immediate-mode GUI. It doesn't cache anything and isn't the most efficient, but it works very well for my purposes. Casey Muratori's [talk on this](https://youtu.be/Z1qyvQsjK5Y) was invaluable
